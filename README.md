## User Instructions

Follow these steps to use the RBAC system effectively:

---

### 1. Initial Setup
1. Open the application in your browser.
2. Ensure that you allow the application to access your browser's localStorage to save data.

---

### 2. Creating Permissions
1. Navigate to the **Permission Management** page:
   - This page allows you to create new permissions for controlling user actions.
2. Click on the **"Add Permission"** button.
3. Enter the **Permission Name** (e.g., `create_user`, `delete_role`).
4. Save the permission.
5. Repeat for as many permissions as needed.

**Note**: Permissions must be created first as they are required to define roles.

---

### 3. Managing Roles
1. Navigate to the **Role Management** page:
   - This page allows you to define roles and assign permissions.
2. Click on the **"Add Role"** button.
3. Enter the **Role Name** (e.g., `Admin`, `Editor`).
4. Select the permissions you want to assign to the role.
5. Save the role.

**Tip**: You can edit or delete roles as required.

---

### 4. Managing Users
1. Navigate to the **User Management** page:
   - This page allows you to create and manage users.
2. Click on the **"Add User"** button.
3. Enter the **User Details**:
   - **Name**: Full name of the user.
   - **Email**: Email address of the user.
   - **Role**: Select a role for the user.
4. Save the user.
5. Users can be edited or deleted at any time.

---

### 5. Filtering Data
1. Use the **Search or Filter Bar** available on the **Users**, **Roles**, and **Permissions** pages.
   - Enter a keyword or phrase to quickly find specific records.
   - Filtering applies to the displayed data only, making it easier to manage large datasets.

---

### 6. Pagination
1. Navigate through the data using the **Pagination Controls** at the bottom of the table.
   - Use the **Next** and **Previous** buttons to view more pages.
   - You can also jump to a specific page using the page numbers.
2. Pagination ensures smooth navigation, even with large datasets.

---

### 7. Viewing the Dashboard
1. Navigate to the **Dashboard**:
   - This page provides a graphical overview of the system.
2. Check the charts for:
   - **User vs Status**: Displays the number of active and inactive users.
   - **User vs Roles**: Shows the distribution of users across roles.

---

### 8. LocalStorage Notes
- All data (users, roles, and permissions) is stored in your browser's localStorage.
- Clearing your browserâ€™s cache will delete all data.

---

### 9. Resetting Data
If you need to reset the application:
1. Open your browser's developer tools (usually accessible via F12 or right-click > Inspect).
2. Navigate to the **Application** tab.
3. Select **LocalStorage** and clear the data for the current site.
4. Refresh the application.

---

### 10. Best Practices for Usage
- Always define **Permissions** before creating **Roles**.
- Assign roles thoughtfully to ensure users have appropriate access levels.
- Use **Filters** and **Pagination** to efficiently manage large datasets.
